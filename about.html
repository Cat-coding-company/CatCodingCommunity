      <h2>Who are we?</h2>
      <h4>We're just a group of coders who want to help others build websites.</h4>
      <h4>We learn new things every day and want to share our skills to the web community. Thus, CCC was born!</h4>
      <h2>Credits</h4>
      <h4>Our site was created with the help of the <b>Techno Academy</b> organization.</h4>
      <h4>They are a group founded by a friend and we help each other create sites.</h4> 
      <h4>You can find their site <a href="https://technoacademyteam.github.io/TechnoAcademySite/">here</a>.</h4>
