      <h2>Who are we?</h2>
      <h4>We're just a group of coders who want to help others build websites. We learn new things every day and want to share our skills to the web community. Thus, CCC was born!</h4>

      <h4>Our site was created with the help of the <b>Techno Academy</b> organization. They are a group founded by a friend and we help each other create sites.</h4>
